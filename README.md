iOS Basket Challenge


Create a shopping basket, basket item and basket item types.

Design and create a UI that displays:
- the contents of the shopping basket;
- the total cost of the basket; and 
- the most expensive item.

Create forms that allows the user to add new basket items and basket item types.

This will be tested by adding a banana ($3), detergent ($10) and a packet of pasta ($1 each)
You should create objects for the basket, basketitem and basketitemtypes.

You will use the below RESTful APIs when creating new objects 
https://aba-systems.com.au/api/v1/baskets/
https://aba-systems.com.au/api/v1/basketitems/
https://aba-systems.com.au/api/v1/basketitemtypes/


Must store and fetch all objects from core data.

Extra credit given for being able to sychronize data after being offline.
